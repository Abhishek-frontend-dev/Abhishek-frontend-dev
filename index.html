      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Abhishek Kumar, a passionate front-end developer who loves
        learning and solving challenges. I’m always curious about how websites
        are built and love diving into the details to figure things out.
        Whenever I come across something new or difficult, I see it as a chance
        to learn and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I’m focused on testing and improving my skills through
        real-world projects, as I believe hands-on experience is the best way to
        learn. My goal is to build large, impactful web applications that make a
        difference. If something seems difficult, I don’t back away—I make it my
        priority to tackle it head-on.

            <div>
              This Product Filter App was an exciting project where I
              implemented dynamic filtering features using React The app allows
              users to sort and filter products
              <p class="iteme">
                based on various criteria, providing a seamless and interactive
                experience. Working on this project helped me better understand
                state management with the useState hook and how to handle user
                inputs effectively. It also strengthened my skills in creating
                reusable components and managing props for dynamic
                functionality. This project gave me valuable insights into
                building feature-rich, user-friendly React applications

              This Product Filter App includes features like filtering products

                JavaScript array methods, DOM manipulation, and creating

                to show the restaurant’s location also helped me understand
                working with APIs. This project allowed me to blend design with

              The Marks Calculator project is a tool that calculates a student's
              total marks, percentage, and grade based on their scores.I
              developed this project using JavaScript
              <p class="iteme">
                to handle conditional logic allowing the calculator to display
                the grade directly in an input field—a feature that earned me
                recognition from my teacher. While others faced challenges
                implementing this, I quickly solved it, strengthening my
                understanding of JavaScript comparison and conditional flows.
                This project was an excellent opportunity to practice logic
                building and improve my skills in creating interactive and
                functional web tools.

            <h2>Calculator In Js</h2>
            <div>
              The Calculator project was one of my first challenges in
              JavaScript . As a beginner I focused on creating
              <p class="iteme">
                everything from scratch which made it a truly valuable learning
                experience. I learned how to use functions to handle elements,
                like buttons and inputs, and how to manage calculations
                dynamically. Though simple, this project was a great challenge
                that helped me understand JavaScript fundamentals and the
                importance of structure and logic in coding. It reinforced my
                problem-solving skills and boosted my confidence in building
                interactive applications
